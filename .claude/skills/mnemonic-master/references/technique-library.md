## 2. RHYMES & RHYTHM

### Perfect Rhymes
End sounds match exactly.

## 3. VISUAL IMAGERY & MENTAL PICTURES

### Bizarre/Absurd Images
The weirder, the more memorable.

```
TERM: Biceps supinates the forearm
IMAGE: A muscular arm holding a SOUP bowl, turning it to drink -
"SUPinate = holding SUP (soup)"

TERM: Piriformis muscle (pear-shaped)
IMAGE: A giant pear sitting in your buttock, rotating your leg outward

TERM: Sternocleidomastoid turns head
IMAGE: A STERN MAST on a ship (sternum + mastoid) turning the ship's "head"
```

### Action Sequences
Visualize the movement or process.

```
TERM: Lymphatic drainage proximal to distal
IMAGE: Emptying a clogged highway from the exit backwards -
clear the exit before more cars can leave

TERM: Peristalsis
IMAGE: Squeezing toothpaste from the tube -
wave-like contractions pushing contents forward
```

### Body Mapping
Use your own body as a memory palace.

```
TERM: Spleen meridian path
ACTION: Trace from big toe, up inner leg, through VMO, to spleen
"Draw the line on your body while studying"

TERM: Carpal tunnel contents
ACTION: Make a fist and look at your wrist -
"9 tendons and 1 nerve squeeze through that tiny tunnel"
```

### Color Coding
Assign colors to categories.

```
YIN organs = BLUE (cool, receptive, storing)
YANG organs = RED (hot, active, transforming)

Flexors = GREEN (bending, like a green branch)
Extensors = YELLOW (straightening, like sunlight)
```

---

## 4. PHONETIC & SOUND-BASED

### Sound-Alikes (Homophone Exploitation)
```
Vagus nerve → "VAGUE" → slow, relaxed → slows heart rate

Pisiform bone → "PEA" → pea-shaped, pinky side

Piriformis → "PEAR" → pear-shaped muscle

Acetylcholine → "ACT" → makes muscles ACT/contract
```

### Alliteration
Same starting sounds.

```
"Bile Breaks Big Fat" (bile emulsifies fats)

"Fascia Fixes Form" (fascia maintains body structure)

"Proximal First, Pump Freely" (lymph drainage direction)

"Tendons Tie To bones" (tendon function)
```

### Consonance/Assonance

```

---

## 5. CHUNKING & GROUPING

### Number Chunking
Break long sequences into memorable groups.

```
Phone numbers: 555-867-5309 (not 5558675309)

Muscle fiber types: "1-2A-2B" (Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB)
"1 is slow, 2 is fast, A is aerobic, B is big bursts"
```

### Category Chunking
Group by shared characteristics.

```
Flexors of the elbow (3 muscles):
"BBC" - Biceps, Brachialis, Brachioradialis
"The BBC reports: your elbow is flexed!"

Hip adductors (5 muscles):
"PLGAB" - Pectineus, Longus, Gracilis, Adductor Brevis, Adductor Magnus
"Please Let Girls Across Bars" (adductors bring legs together)
```

### Spatial Chunking
Organize by location.

```
Anterior thigh muscles: "4 Quadriceps"
Posterior thigh muscles: "3 Hamstrings"
Medial thigh muscles: "5 Adductors"

"4-3-5 around the thigh"
```

---

## 6. STORIES & NARRATIVES

### Journey Method
Create a story that travels through concepts.

```
TERM: Digestive tract path
STORY: "Food enters the mouth casino (oral cavity), slides down the
esophagus elevator, lands in the stomach pool, passes through the
pyloric bouncer into the small intestine dance floor (where nutrients
party), then exits through the large intestine lobby and out the back door."
```

### Character Method
Personify concepts.

```
TERM: Sympathetic vs Parasympathetic
STORY: "Two brothers - Sam Sympathetic is the fighter (fight-or-flight),
always ready for action, heart racing. His brother Pete Parasympathetic
is the chiller (rest-and-digest), always calming things down, slowing
the heart, digesting dinner."
```

### Cause-Effect Chains
```
TERM: Muscle contraction sequence
STORY: "The nerve calls (action potential) → calcium rushes in (like
guests at a party) → calcium unlocks the dance floor (troponin/tropomyosin)
→ actin and myosin can finally dance together (cross-bridge formation)
→ the muscle shortens (contraction)"
```

---

## 7. METHOD OF LOCI (MEMORY PALACE)

### Room-Based
Place items in familiar locations.

```
TERM: 12 Cranial Nerves
LOCATION: Your bedroom

1. Olfactory - Smell coffee on nightstand
2. Optic - Look at window (optic = seeing)
3. Oculomotor - Eye mask on pillow (ocul = eye movement)
4. Trochlear - Pulley system on ceiling fan (trochlea = pulley)
5. Trigeminal - Triple mirror on dresser (tri = three)
...continue through room
```

### Body-Based
Use your own body as the palace.

```
TERM: Chakra locations
Your body IS the memory palace - each chakra at its actual location

TERM: Meridian endpoints
Trace on your own body - the location IS the memory
```

---

## 8. ANALOGIES & METAPHORS

### Everyday Object Analogies
```
"Bile is like dish soap" - both break fat into droplets

"Fascia is like plastic wrap" - surrounds and contains

"The heart is a pump" - two chambers, in and out

"Nerves are like electrical wires" - conduct signals

"Lymph system is like a sewer system" - drains waste
```

### Process Analogies
```
"Muscle contraction is like a rowing team" -
coordinated pulling in one direction

"Bone remodeling is like road construction" -
osteoclasts break down (demolition), osteoblasts build up (construction)

"Blood clotting is like a dam" -
platelets pile up to stop the flow
```

---

## 9. OPPOSITES & CONTRASTS

### Paired Opposites
```
"Flexors FLEX, Extensors EXTEND" (obvious but effective)

"Agonist ACTS, Antagonist OPPOSES"

"Afferent ARRIVES (sensory to brain), Efferent EXITS (motor from brain)"

"YIN is IN (internal, storing), YANG is OUT (external, transforming)"
```

### Compare and Contrast
```
"Acute = Ice It, Chronic = Heat It"
(Acute inflammation needs cooling, chronic needs warming)

"Ligaments Link bone-to-bone, Tendons Tie muscle-to-bone"
(Both connect, but different structures)
```

---

## 10. ETYMOLOGY & WORD ROOTS

### Latin/Greek Roots
```
"Coracoid" = crow-like (korax = crow)
"The short head attaches to the crow's beak!"

"A pear sitting in your glute"

"Deltoid" = triangle-shaped (delta = Greek letter triangle)
"The triangular shoulder cap"

"Gastrocnemius" = stomach of the leg (gaster = stomach, kneme = leg)
"The belly of the calf"
```

### Breaking Down Complex Terms
```
"Sternocleidomastoid" = sternum + cleido (clavicle) + mastoid
"Connects the STERN to the MAST" (sternum to mastoid process)

"Thoracolumbar" = thoracic + lumbar
"T-L junction is the TERROR LAUNCHER" (sympathetic fight-or-flight)
```

4 = sailboat (triangular sail)
5 = hook
6 = elephant trunk
7 = cliff edge
8 = snowman
9 = balloon on string
0 = ball/egg
```

### Counting Patterns

Pisiform is there for you,
Trapezium, trapezoid here,
Capitate and hamate near"
```

### Rhythm and Beat
```
(Rap rhythm)
"Flexors FLEX and Extensors EXTEND,
Abductors take AWAY from the midline friend,
Adductors ADD back to center again,
Rotators ROTATE - that's the end!"
```

---

## 14. EMOTIONAL ANCHORING

### Fear-Based (for dangers/contraindications)
```
"NEVER massage over a DVT - it could KILL them!"
(Deep vein thrombosis - clot could travel to lungs)

"RED = DEAD" for red flag symptoms
```

### Humor-Based
```
"The FUNNY bone isn't funny at all - it's the ULNAR nerve!"

"Gluteus Maximus - the muscle that makes your 'assets' look good"
```
