Your test answer is **always going to be** the gentlest stroke, and that's effleurage **every single time**! Remember your mnemonic: \"Easy Flow Eases Spastics\" - gentle gliding strokes calm down those overactive nerves through gate control theory (yeah, that'll probably be mentioned too).\n\nThe exam loves this connection because effleurage improves circulation without aggravating the condition. \n\n💡 **Pro tip:** if you see any question about conditions with \"overactive\" or \"hyper\" anything, go gentle - go effleurage!",

When you see Psoas Major, Biceps Femoris, and Popliteus together on the exam, your brain should instantly scream \"FLEXION!\" Don't get distracted by where these muscles are located - that's a trap the test loves to set. The Psoas flexes your hip, Biceps Femoris flexes your knee, and Popliteus also flexes the knee. Remember \"PBP = Please Bend Please!\" because ALL three are benders at their joints!

The short head of biceps brachii attaches to the coracoid process, and here's your money trick: \"Short Crow!\" Coracoid literally means crow-like because it looks like a crow's beak sticking out from your shoulder blade. ⚠️ **Don't overthink** it - when you see \"short head of biceps,\" immediately think crow's beak!

    "topic_explanation": "🎯 **Here's what matters** - you **NEED** to nail this concept for the exam! When treating edema, always work **proximal to distal segments** - start with the thigh, then move down to the leg. Don't get tricked by the stroke direction! The question is asking which body SEGMENT to work first, not which way your hands move. Think of it like this: you've got to clear the highway (thigh) before you can move traffic from the side streets (lower leg). If you try to push fluid up from the ankle first, it's just going to hit a traffic jam! The key test-taking trick here is remembering \"Proximal First = Make Room!\" - you're literally creating space in those upper vessels so the lower fluid has somewhere to go. ⚠️ **Don't overthink** this one - they love testing whether you know to prep the proximal area FIRST before working the distal areas!",
    "incorrect_explanations": {
      "a": "Working distal to proximal refers to stroke direction, not segment selection - you'd push fluid into already congested proximal vessels",

    "topic_explanation": "🎯 **Here's the deal** - this question WILL show up on your exam, so lock this in! When you see \"varicose ulcers\" on the test, your brain should immediately scream \"FRAGILE TISSUE + BAD CIRCULATION!\" ⚠️ **Don't overthink** it - you absolutely MUST work from healthy tissue (periphery) toward the damaged area (wound) to push that stagnant fluid where it needs to go. Think of it like unclogging a drain - you push FROM the clear area TO the clogged spot! The exam loves testing this concept because students often think backwards and want to work away from wounds. NOPE! That's the trap answer that'll kill your score. Remember your mnemonic: PUSH to WOUND - periphery pushes toward the wound like moving traffic away from a jam.\n\nAnd here's your exam hack: if you see any deep pressure options with varicose ulcers, cross them out immediately - that tissue is too fragile and the test makers know students fall for those heavy-handed techniques!",

    "topic_explanation": "🎯 **Let's break this down** - ! You **NEED** to nail this concept for the exam - both tibialis muscles are your inversion powerhouses! Don't get distracted by their individual tricks (anterior does dorsiflexion, posterior does plantarflexion) - that's exam trap material right there! When they team up together, they're pulling that medial border of the foot UP and IN, creating pure inversion **every single time**. Here's your money move: picture both muscles yanking the inside edge of the foot toward the body's midline - that's inversion, baby!

Don't get tricked by yellow marrow - that's just fat storage doing nothing important for blood production. The exam might try to confuse you with fancy terms like \"hematopoietic stem cells\" or \"erythropoiesis,\" but just remember they're all happening in RED bone marrow.

    "mnemonic": "WATER flows to the KIDNEYS! Think of kidneys filtering water in your body - they're the Water element organs! 'Kidneys CLEAN the water, Bladder STORES the water' = WATER element!",
    "topic_explanation": "🎯 **Important point** - In Traditional Chinese Medicine's Five Element theory, Water is associated with the Kidney and Bladder meridians. The Water element represents winter, the emotion of fear, the color black/blue, and governs bones, teeth, and head hair. The Kidneys are considered the root of life in TCM, storing Jing (essence) and governing growth, development, and reproduction.",

      "a": "Fire is associated with the Heart and Small Intestine meridians",

    "correct_answer_text": "Petrissage",
    "rewrite_question": "Which Swedish massage stroke is characterized by kneading, lifting, and squeezing soft tissue?",
    "mnemonic": "PETRISSAGE = PIZZA DOUGH! Think of kneading pizza dough - lifting, squeezing, rolling. That's exactly what petrissage does to muscles! 'PETRIssage = kneading like making PIZza!'",
    "topic_explanation": "🎯 **Important point** - Petrissage is a Swedish massage technique that involves kneading, lifting, squeezing, and rolling the soft tissue. It increases circulation, helps remove metabolic waste, and stretches muscle fibers. Types include kneading, wringing, skin rolling, and picking up. Petrissage is typically performed after effleurage has warmed up the tissue.",
    "incorrect_explanations": {
      "a": "Effleurage is gliding strokes used to spread lubricant and warm tissue - no lifting or squeezing",
      "c": "Tapotement is rhythmic percussion/tapping movements like hacking and cupping",
      "d": "Friction involves deep, focused pressure applied in circular or cross-fiber movements without lifting"

    "mnemonic": "FIBRO = FIBER pain everywhere! 'Fibromyalgia = FULL-body FIBROUS muscle ACHE!' Remember: widespread pain + fatigue + tender points = Fibromyalgia. It's like the muscles are crying out everywhere!",
    "topic_explanation": "🎯 **Important point** - Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties ('fibro fog'). It involves tender points at specific locations. While massage is generally beneficial, therapists must use lighter pressure and monitor client response carefully. It's not inflammatory like arthritis - it's a central sensitization syndrome.",
    "incorrect_explanations": {
      "a": "Osteoarthritis is joint degeneration affecting specific joints, not widespread muscle pain with tender points",
      "c": "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory condition primarily affecting joints symmetrically",
