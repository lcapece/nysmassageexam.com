### Why the NYS Exam is More Challenging

1. **Eastern Medicine Requirement**: 20 questions on meridians, acupressure points, Yin/Yang theory, and Traditional Chinese Medicine concepts - topics many Western-trained therapists struggle with.

2. **Limited Test Opportunities**: Only 2 chances per year vs. MBLEx's year-round availability. Missing an exam means waiting 6 months.

3. **Paper-Based Format**: No ability to flag and return to questions easily. Must manage time without computer aids.

4. **Higher Education Requirement**: NYS requires 1,000 hours of training (one of the highest in the US) vs. many states requiring only 500-750 hours.

5. **Delayed Results**: Weeks of waiting vs. immediate MBLEx results adds psychological pressure.

6. **Treatment Planning Focus**: 27% of exam focuses on developing treatment plans - requires critical thinking, not just memorization.

7. **NY-Specific Regulations**: Must know NYS massage therapy laws, advertising rules, and scope of practice specifics.
