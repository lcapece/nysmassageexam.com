  1: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Spastic paralysis involves involuntary muscle contractions and increased muscle tone. Effleurage provides gentle, rhythmic, gliding strokes that calm the nervous system.\\\\n\\\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: \"Easy Flow\" = Effleurage for spastics. Gentle gliding soothes overactive nerves.\\\\n\\\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Don't pick stimulating strokes like tapotement - they worsen spasticity!\\\\n\\\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Effleurage's gentle, calming input reduces hyperactive muscle tone without triggering protective reflexes.",
  2: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The pisiform is a small, pea-shaped carpal bone located on the medial (pinky) side of the wrist at the wrist crease.\\\\n\\\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Pisiform = Pea-shaped = Pinky side! Think 'Pea on Pinky side of Palm'.\\\\n\\\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Don't confuse with scaphoid (thumb side) or trapezium (base of thumb).\\\\n\\\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The pisiform sits directly at the medial wrist crease, easily palpable when flexing the wrist.",
  3: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Psoas Major flexes the hip, Biceps Femoris flexes the knee, and Popliteus flexes the knee. All three share flexion as their common action.\\\\n\\\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: PBP = Please Bend Please! All three muscles bend joints.\\\\n\\\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Focus on the common action, not individual muscles. They all flex different joints.\\\\n\\\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Despite working at different joints (hip and knee), flexion is the movement they all perform.",
  4: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The biceps brachii has two heads. The short head originates from the coracoid process of the scapula, while the long head comes from the supraglenoid tubercle.\\\\n\\\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Short = Coracoid! Think 'Short Crow' (coracoid means crow-like). The short head attaches to the crow's beak!\\\\n\\\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Don't confuse coracoid (scapula) with coronoid (ulna) - they sound similar!\\\\n\\\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The coracoid process is the anterior projection of the scapula where the short head attaches.",
  5: "🎯 **Key Concept**: For edema treatment, work proximal segments FIRST to create space for fluid drainage, then work distal segments. This clears the 'highway' before directing traffic.\\\\n\\\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Proximal First = Make Room! Think 'Empty the Highway before directing Traffic' - clear the upper route before moving fluid from below.\\\\n\\\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: This is about segment order, NOT stroke direction. Work thigh before calf before foot.\\\\n\\\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Working proximal first opens lymphatic pathways so fluid has somewhere to drain when you work distally.",
  6: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Varicose ulcers have compromised tissue integrity. Use gentle finger kneading from the periphery (healthy tissue) toward the wound edge to promote circulation and healing.\\\\n\\\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: PUSH to WOUND: Push circulation from Periphery toward Wound - like pushing nutrients to the healing area!\\\\n\\\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Never use deep effleurage on varicose ulcers - too aggressive for fragile tissue!\\\\n\\\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Working from periphery inward brings fresh blood and lymph to the healing area without damaging fragile tissue.",
  7: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior are the primary invertors of the foot. When contracted together, they turn the sole of the foot inward (inversion).\\\\n\\\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Both Tibialis = Inversion! Think 'TIB = Turn Inward, Buddy!'\\\\n\\\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Both muscles invert - their other actions cancel out (dorsi vs plantar), leaving only inversion.\\\\n\\\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Inversion is the only action both muscles share. Their flexion actions oppose each other.",
  8: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The digestive tract follows this sequence: Mouth → Pharynx → Esophagus → Stomach → Small intestine → Large intestine → Rectum → Anus.\\\\n\\\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: My Purple Elephant Swallowed Small Little Red Apples! (Mouth, Pharynx, Esophagus, Stomach, Small, Large, Rectum, Anus)\\\\n\\\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: The pharynx comes BEFORE the esophagus - it's the shared passage for food and air.\\\\n\\\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Food passes through the pharynx (throat) immediately after the mouth, before entering the esophagus.",
  9: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Its primary function is to emulsify fats, breaking them into smaller droplets for easier digestion.\\\\n\\\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Bile Breaks Blobs! It breaks fat blobs into tiny droplets for absorption.\\\\n\\\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Bile emulsifies (breaks down) fats - it doesn't digest proteins or carbs!\\\\n\\\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Bile's detergent-like properties emulsify dietary fats, increasing surface area for lipase enzymes to work.",
  10: "🎯 **Key Concept**: During muscle contraction, actin (thin filaments) slide past myosin (thick filaments), shortening the sarcomere. The filaments themselves don't change length.\\\\n\\\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Actin Acts! Actin thin filaments slide over thick myosin to shorten the muscle.\\\\n\\\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Filaments SLIDE past each other - they don't shrink! The sarcomere shortens, not the filaments.\\\\n\\\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The sliding filament theory shows actin thin filaments are pulled toward the center of the sarcomere by myosin.",
  11: "🎯 **Key Concept**: NYS requires massage therapists to maintain all advertising records (business cards, websites, social media, etc.) in their permanent business files.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Advertise? Archive! Keep ALL ads in your permanent files - NYS wants proof!\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: This includes digital advertising (websites, social media) - not just print materials!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: NYS law mandates permanent record-keeping of all advertising to ensure compliance and accountability.",
  12: "🎯 **Key Concept**: NYS massage law allows therapists to specialize and limit their practice to specific populations (e.g., prenatal, geriatric, athletes) without restrictions.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Specialize with Pride! NYS says you CAN limit your practice to your specialty.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: You CAN refuse clients outside your specialty - it's professional, not discriminatory!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Specialization is encouraged in NYS as it promotes expertise and quality care within defined scopes.",
  13: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The soleus lies deep to the gastrocnemius in the posterior lower leg. Together they form the triceps surae and attach to the calcaneus via the Achilles tendon.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Soleus = Solo under Gastrocnemius! It's the solo deep muscle under the twins (gastrocnemius heads).\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Soleus is DEEP - you must work through gastrocnemius to reach it!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The soleus is positioned directly beneath the gastrocnemius in the posterior compartment of the leg.",
  14: "🎯 **Key Concept**: In TCM, the Lungs are called the 'lid of the Yin organs' because they sit at the top of the torso, protecting other Yin organs below like a lid.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Lungs = Lid! They sit on top protecting organs below, just like a jar lid.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: This is TCM theory terminology - 'lid' refers to position, not function!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The Lungs' superior anatomical position in the chest cavity makes them the 'lid' covering other Yin organs.",
  15: "🎯 **Key Concept**: In TCM, the Lungs control Wei Qi (defensive/protective energy), which circulates on the body's surface protecting against external pathogens.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Lungs = Shield! They control Wei Qi, your body's protective shield on the surface.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Wei Qi is DEFENSIVE energy on the surface - different from nutritive Qi inside!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Lung Qi spreads Wei Qi to the skin and exterior, forming the body's first line of immune defense.",
  16: "🎯 **Key Concept**: In TCM, Yin organs (Zang) are solid, dense structures that store vital substances (Qi, Blood, Essence). They include Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lungs, Kidneys.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Yin = Storage! Solid organs Store precious substances. Yang = Hollow, they transform and transport.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Don't confuse Yin (solid, store) with Yang (hollow, transform) organs!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Yin organs have dense, solid tissue structure designed for storing and preserving vital substances.",
  17: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The Spleen meridian (SP) travels up the medial leg, through the anterior pelvis, and connects to the spleen organ in the upper left abdomen.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Spleen Sprints up the Medial Side! Think 'SP = Side Path' up the inner leg.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Spleen meridian is MEDIAL (inner leg) - don't confuse with lateral meridians!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The SP meridian pathway follows the medial aspect of the lower limb before reaching the abdomen.",
  18: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Retinaculum and ITB (iliotibial band) are both specialized fascial structures - dense connective tissue that provides structural support and compartmentalization.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Retinaculum & ITB = Fascia Family! Both are tough connective tissue bands that stabilize.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: They're FASCIA, not muscles! They're passive support structures.\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Both are thickened bands of deep fascia that stabilize and organize surrounding structures.",
  19: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The Lung meridian (LU) begins at the lateral chest (pectoralis major), travels over the anterior shoulder, down the lateral arm, and ends at the thumb's lateral nail.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Lung Loves Lateral! LU starts lateral chest, goes lateral arm, ends lateral thumb.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: LU is on the THUMB side (lateral/radial) - not the pinky side!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The LU meridian follows the lateral/radial aspect of the upper limb, terminating at the thumb.",
  20: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) attaches directly to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. It's a primary site of tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis).\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: ECRB = Epicondyle Connection! ECRB attaches at the lateral epicondyle where tennis elbow happens.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: ECRB is THE tennis elbow muscle - know this attachment!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: ECRB originates from the lateral epicondyle, making it vulnerable to repetitive strain (tennis elbow).",
  21: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The biceps brachii performs two main actions: elbow flexion (bending) and forearm supination (turning palm up). Supination is the 'soup' motion.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Biceps = Bend & Bring the Soup! Flex the elbow and supinate (turn palm up) to carry soup.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Supination is NOT pronation - it's turning the palm UP (like holding soup)!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The biceps' attachment on the radial tuberosity allows it to rotate the radius, causing supination.",
  22: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Teres minor is located superior to teres major along the lateral border of the scapula. It's part of the rotator cuff and externally rotates the shoulder.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Minor = Higher! Teres MINOR sits ABOVE teres major on the scapula.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Don't flip them - minor is SUPERIOR, major is INFERIOR!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Teres minor originates from the upper lateral scapular border, positioned above the larger teres major.",
  23: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Rounded shoulders result from tight anterior muscles (pec major/minor, anterior deltoid). To correct posture, you must lengthen the SHORTENED anterior muscles.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Rounded = Release the Front! Tight chest pulls shoulders forward - release the shortened side!\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Work the TIGHT side (anterior) to lengthen it - not the already overstretched posterior muscles!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Lengthening the shortened anterior muscles allows the shoulders to return to neutral alignment.",
  24: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The sympathetic nervous system originates from the thoracolumbar region (T1-L2 spinal segments). This is the 'fight or flight' response center.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Sympathetic = T-L = Thoraco-Lumbar! Think 'Fight from Torso & Lower back'.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Sympathetic is T1-L2 (middle), NOT craniosacral (that's parasympathetic)!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Sympathetic preganglionic neurons emerge from the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord segments.",
  25: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The musculocutaneous nerve (C5-C7) innervates three anterior arm muscles: biceps brachii, brachialis, and coracobrachialis (the BBC muscles).\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Musculocutaneous = BBC! Biceps, Brachialis, Coracobrachialis - the British Broadcasting Corporation of the arm!\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: All three BBC muscles are in the ANTERIOR compartment - not posterior!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The musculocutaneous nerve pierces and innervates all three muscles in the anterior arm compartment.",
  26: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Rectus femoris is unique - it's the only quadriceps muscle that crosses BOTH the hip and knee joints. The others only cross the knee.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Rectus = Two Joints! It's the only quad that crosses hip AND knee - the overachiever!\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: The other three quads (vastus muscles) only cross the knee - rectus femoris is special!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Rectus femoris originates on the pelvis (AIIS), crossing the hip, while other quads originate on the femur.",
  27: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Fibrous ankylosis involves abnormal fibrous tissue formation that restricts joint movement. Massage helps by stretching and mobilizing the fibrous adhesions.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Fibrous = Fibers stuck! Massage stretches the stuck fibers to restore movement.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Fibrous ankylosis is RESTRICTION from scar tissue - massage can help (unlike bony ankylosis)!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Massage mechanically stretches fibrous tissue, improving joint mobility when restriction is soft tissue-based.",
  28: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Tendons are dense fibrous connective tissue composed primarily of collagen fibers. They connect muscle to bone, transmitting contractile force.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Tendons = Tough Cords! Collagen-packed cords connect muscle to bone.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Tendons connect muscle-to-bone. Ligaments connect bone-to-bone!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Collagen fibers provide tensile strength, allowing tendons to transmit muscle force to skeletal attachments.",
  29: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The Pes Anserine ('goose foot') is where three muscles insert on the medial tibia: Sartorius, Gracilis, Semitendinosus (SGS).\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: SGS = Say Goodnight to Sartorius, Gracilis, Semitendinosus! They form the goose foot.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: All THREE muscles attach at the pes anserine - memorize SGS!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: These three tendons merge to form a flat, webbed insertion resembling a goose's foot on the medial tibia.",
  30: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Acute plantar fasciitis involves ACTIVE inflammation. Ice is contraindicated acutely because it can prolong healing by reducing necessary inflammatory responses.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Acute = Active inflammation! Don't ice acute inflammation - you need it to heal!\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: This is ACUTE (recent injury) - chronic is different! Ice reduces helpful acute inflammation.\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Acute inflammation is necessary for tissue healing. Suppressing it with ice delays the repair process.",
  31: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Plantar fasciitis treatment involves mobilizing the plantar fascia and surrounding muscles. Work the foot's bottom structures to reduce tension and adhesions.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Plant your hands on the Plantar surface! Work the bottom of the foot directly.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Work the BOTTOM of the foot (plantar surface) - that's where the fascia is!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Direct work on the plantar fascia and intrinsic foot muscles addresses the source of pain and restriction.",
  32: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The plantar lymphatic plexus is a major lymphatic network in the feet, specifically in the plantar surface. Walking stimulates this 'pump' mechanism.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Plantar Plexus = Foot Pump! Walking pumps lymph from the bottom of your feet.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: The plexus is in the PLANTAR (bottom) surface - walking compresses it to pump lymph!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The plantar surface contains dense lymphatic vessels that are compressed during walking, pumping lymph upward.",
  33: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The Conception Vessel (Ren Mai) in TCM is an extraordinary meridian that runs along the anterior midline, governing Yin energy and reproductive functions.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Conception = Front & Center! Ren Mai runs up the front midline, governing reproduction.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Conception Vessel is ANTERIOR midline - don't confuse with Governing Vessel (posterior)!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Ren Mai travels up the anterior midline from the perineum to the lower lip, regulating Yin.",
  34: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Accessory respiratory muscles include scalenes, SCM, pectoralis minor, and serratus posterior. They assist breathing when demand increases or in respiratory distress.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Accessory = Emergency Air! These muscles kick in when you need extra breathing help.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: These are ACCESSORY (helpers) - primary muscles are diaphragm and external intercostals!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Accessory muscles elevate the rib cage and expand the thorax when primary muscles need assistance.",
  35: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Muscles are classified as tonic (postural stabilizers with slow-twitch fibers) or phasic (movement muscles with fast-twitch fibers). They respond differently to dysfunction.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Tonic = Tight! Tonic muscles tend to tighten when stressed. Phasic = Weak! They tend to weaken.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Tonic muscles SHORTEN when dysfunctional. Phasic muscles LENGTHEN and weaken!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Tonic postural muscles have more slow-twitch fibers that tend toward hypertonicity and shortening.",
  36: "🎯 **Key Concept**: The vagus nerve (CN X) is the primary parasympathetic nerve controlling heart rate via the 'rest and digest' system. It slows heart rate.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Vagus = Vast Relaxation! It's the main nerve that slows your heart for rest.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Vagus DECREASES heart rate (parasympathetic) - sympathetic increases it!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Vagal stimulation releases acetylcholine, which reduces heart rate and promotes relaxation.",
  37: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Erythrocytes (red blood cells) are produced exclusively in red bone marrow through erythropoiesis. Red marrow is found in flat bones and epiphyses of long bones.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Red cells from Red marrow! Erythrocytes are made in red bone marrow only.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: RED marrow makes red blood cells - yellow marrow stores fat!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Red bone marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells that differentiate into erythrocytes.",
  38: "🎯 **Key Concept**: In TCM, Lung (LU) and Large Intestine (LI) are paired Metal element channels. Smoking damages Lung Qi, which weakens its paired Large Intestine, causing constipation.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Lung & Large Intestine = Linked! Weak Lungs = Weak bowels in TCM Metal pair.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: This is TCM theory - Lung and Large Intestine are energetically paired in the Metal element!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: TCM Metal element pairs show that Lung Qi deficiency affects Large Intestine's transportation function.",
  39: "🎯 **Key Concept**: TCM Five Element generation cycle: Wood feeds Fire → Fire creates Earth (ash) → Earth bears Metal → Metal enriches Water → Water nourishes Wood.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Wood Fire Earth Metal Water! Think: 'Campfire makes ash, ash has minerals, minerals feed streams, water grows trees.'\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: This is the GENERATION cycle (mother-child) - not the control cycle!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Each element generates/nourishes the next in the cycle: Wood → Fire → Earth → Metal → Water → Wood.",
  40: "🎯 **Key Concept**: In TCM, the Lung meridian governs skin health because Lungs control exterior defensive Qi and skin moisture. Lung dysfunction manifests as dry, rough skin.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Lungs = Skin's Friend! Healthy Lungs = Healthy skin in TCM.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: This is TCM theory - Lungs govern skin, hair, and pores through Wei Qi circulation!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Lung Qi spreads moisture and defensive energy to the skin surface, maintaining healthy skin texture.",
  41: "🎯 **Key Concept**: In TCM, the Heart is the supreme organ (the Emperor) that houses the Shen (Spirit/Mind) and governs consciousness, emotions, and mental clarity.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Heart = Emperor! It rules all organs and houses your Spirit (Shen).\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: In TCM, Heart governs MIND/SPIRIT - not just circulation!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The Heart's role as Emperor means it coordinates all other organs and houses consciousness.",
  42: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Muscle contraction compresses blood vessels, reducing circulation. Decreased blood flow means less oxygen and nutrients, plus accumulation of metabolic waste (lactic acid).\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Contract = Constrict! Tight muscles squeeze blood vessels shut, starving the tissue.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Compression REDUCES blood flow - this causes pain and fatigue!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Sustained contraction occludes vessels, creating ischemia and metabolic waste buildup.",
  43: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Tapotement encompasses ALL percussive techniques: tapping, hacking, cupping, slapping, beating, and pounding. All involve rhythmic striking movements.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Tapotement = Tap Tap! Any rhythmic percussion/striking is tapotement.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Tapotement is the CATEGORY - hacking, cupping, etc. are all types of tapotement!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Tapotement (from French 'tapoter' = to tap) includes all variations of percussive massage.",
  44: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Acetylcholine (ACh) is THE neurotransmitter at neuromuscular junctions. Motor neurons release ACh to trigger muscle fiber contraction.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: ACh = Action! Acetylcholine triggers muscle ACTION/contraction.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: ACh is the ONLY neurotransmitter at skeletal muscle junctions - not dopamine or serotonin!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: ACh binds to receptors on muscle fibers, initiating the contraction cascade.",
  46: "🎯 **Key Concept**: Putting muscles 'on slack' means positioning to SHORTEN the muscle, reducing tension for therapeutic work. This allows deeper, pain-free treatment.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Slack = Shorten! Move joints to shorten the muscle for relaxed, easy treatment.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: On slack = SHORTENED position - NOT stretched! Bring origin and insertion closer.\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Shortening a muscle reduces tension and protective guarding, allowing more effective treatment.",
  47: "🎯 **Key Concept**: For low back pain clients, proper positioning reduces spinal compression and muscle strain. Prone: pillow under hips. Supine: knees supported/bent.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Low Back = Lift & Support! Prone: lift hips. Supine: support knees.\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Support the LOW back's natural curve - don't flatten it!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: Proper support maintains lumbar lordosis and reduces muscle tension during treatment.",
  48: "🎯 **Key Concept**: A saddle joint has two concave-convex surfaces fitting together like a rider on a saddle. It allows flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction.\\n\\n💡 **Memory Tip**: Saddle = Sitting Rider! Like sitting in a saddle - rock front/back, side/side, and circle around!\\n\\n⚠️ **Exam Alert**: Saddle joints allow circumduction - think thumb CMC joint movement!\\n\\n✅ **Why Correct**: The reciprocal concave-convex surfaces allow multi-axial movement including circumduction."
